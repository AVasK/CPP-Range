# CPP-Range
## That cool range syntax from Python now in C++

Remember when you wrote a simple range-for in Python and said:
"Wow, why C++ can't have this?"
```Python 
  for i in range(start, end, step)
```

Well, now it can!

```C++
  for (auto i : range(start, end, step)
```

Or, if you did not... 
Well, there's nothing else here, sorry
